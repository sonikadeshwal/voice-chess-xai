## 📌 Overview

**Voice Chess XAI** is an intelligent, accessible chess system that lets you play chess entirely through voice commands — no mouse or keyboard needed. After every AI move, the system generates a **plain-English explanation** of *why* that move was chosen, covering threat analysis, positional advantages, piece safety, and alternative comparisons.

This project sits at the intersection of:
- 🎙️ **Speech Recognition** — browser-native audio input to SpeechRecognition
- ♟️ **AI Search** — Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning + neural network board evaluation
- 🧠 **Explainable AI (XAI)** — human-readable move justifications after every decision
- 🖥️ **Interactive UI** — real-time Streamlit chess board with full game logging

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🎙️ **Voice Input** | Speak moves naturally — e.g. *"move knight to F3"* — captured via `st.audio_input` |
| ♟️ **AI Engine** | Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning with configurable search depth |
| 🧠 **Neural Network Eval** | Optional NN-based board evaluation for deeper positional understanding |
| 💡 **XAI Explanations** | Post-move reasoning covering checks, captures, development, and positional control |
| 📋 **Game Log** | Full move-by-move history with AI rationale recorded in real time |
| 🖥️ **Interactive Board** | Visual chess board rendered directly in Streamlit |
| 🔊 **Speech Feedback** | Audio confirmation of recognized moves and AI responses |
| ☁️ **Cloud Deployed** | Fully live on Streamlit Community Cloud — no local setup needed |

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

```

│
├── app.py           # Streamlit UI — board rendering, game flow, session state
├── engine.py        # AI engine — Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, move generation
├── explain.py       # XAI module — human-readable move explanation generation
├── voice.py         # Voice module — audio capture, speech-to-text, move parsing
└── requirements.txt # All dependencies
```

### Module Breakdown

**`app.py`** — Orchestrates the full application. Handles board visualization, player/AI turn management, voice input triggering, and XAI log display via Streamlit components.

**`engine.py`** — The AI brain. Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient tree search. Supports optional neural network evaluation for more accurate board scoring beyond traditional piece-value heuristics.

**`explain.py`** — The transparency layer. After each AI move, generates a structured natural language explanation including threat detection, positional improvement score, captures, checks, and development reasoning.

**`voice.py`** — The voice pipeline. Captures microphone audio via `st.audio_input`, passes it through `SpeechRecognition`, and maps spoken natural language (e.g. *"bishop to C5"*) to valid UCI/SAN chess notation.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

1. **Voice-First Accessibility** — Play chess hands-free through accurate real-time speech-to-move conversion.
2. **Strong AI with Search Optimization** — Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning ensures efficient, high-quality move computation at configurable depths.
3. **Explainability by Design** — Every AI move comes with a transparent, human-readable justification — not just a move, but a *reason*.

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sonikadeshwal/voice-chess-xai.git
cd voice-chess-xai

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch the app
streamlit run app.py
```

> The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`. Allow microphone access when prompted.

## 🎙️ How to Play

1. Open the live app or run locally.
2. It's your turn — click the **🎙️ Speak Move** button.
3. Say your move aloud — e.g. *"pawn to E4"*, *"knight to F3"*, *"castle kingside"*.
4. The system recognizes your speech, validates the move, and updates the board.
5. The AI computes its response and plays its move.
6. Read the **XAI explanation** below the board to understand the AI's reasoning.
7. Continue until checkmate, draw, or resignation.

## 💡 What Makes It Different

Most chess engines are opaque — they play strong moves but give you nothing. This system adds a **transparency layer** directly into the gameplay loop:

```
AI selects move
      ↓
explain.py analyzes:
  - Was a piece captured?
  - Is this a check or checkmate threat?
  - Does it improve center control or piece activity?
  - What alternatives were considered?
      ↓
Human-readable explanation shown instantly
```

This makes the project relevant not just as a chess tool, but as a demonstration of **Explainable AI principles** applied to a real-time game system.
